# MOVDQ2Q

`MOVDQ2Q` copies 64-bit quadword elements between the register and memory forms allowed by its alignment and masking rules. The pinned XED inventory represents it with 1 normalized encoding record and 1 distinct IFORM/disassembly combination. Those encodings are implementation choices beneath the instruction's architectural meaning; this page keeps them grouped under one mnemonic-level operation.

## Family and availability

- XED extension(s): `SSE2`
- XED category/categories: `DATAXFER`
- ISA set(s): `SSE2`
- vendor classification: `shared-or-unspecified`
- XED mode restriction(s): `16 32 64`
- usable at CPL 3 subject to feature and OS enablement

## Architectural effects

Representative explicit operands: `MMX XMM`. Representative implicit state: not uniformly recorded.

Recorded flag behavior: not uniformly recorded.

## Important forms

- `MOVDQ2Q_MMXq_XMMq` — `MOVDQ2Q`

The form list is intentionally representative rather than a copy of every encoding row. The row-level oracle remains `generated/xed-instructions.tsv`.

## Backend notes

For Idriç this can be considered by a feature-aware optimization pass when its vector, arithmetic, or bit-level semantics match the typed IR. Presence in the complete inventory does not imply universal availability.
