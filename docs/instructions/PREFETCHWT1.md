# PREFETCHWT1

`PREFETCHWT1` hints that a memory line will soon be written while expressing a weaker temporal-locality preference. The pinned XED inventory represents it with 1 normalized encoding record and 1 distinct IFORM/disassembly combination. Those encodings are implementation choices beneath the instruction's architectural meaning; this page keeps them grouped under one mnemonic-level operation.

## Family and availability

- XED extension(s): `PREFETCHWT1`
- XED category/categories: `PREFETCHWT1`
- ISA set(s): `PREFETCHWT1`
- vendor classification: `shared-or-unspecified`
- XED mode restriction(s): `16 32 64`
- usable at CPL 3 subject to feature and OS enablement

## Architectural effects

Representative explicit operands: `MEM`. Representative implicit state: not uniformly recorded.

Recorded flag behavior: not uniformly recorded.

## Important forms

- `PREFETCHWT1_MEMu8` — `PREFETCHWT1`

The form list is intentionally representative rather than a copy of every encoding row. The row-level oracle remains `generated/xed-instructions.tsv`.

## Backend notes

For Idriç this instruction is documented independently of support status. A lowering should be added only when a typed IR operation or deliberate optimization maps to these semantics more clearly than a simpler baseline sequence.
