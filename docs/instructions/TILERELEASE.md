# TILERELEASE

`TILERELEASE` releases AMX tile state so the processor may reclaim tile resources. The pinned XED inventory represents it with 1 normalized encoding record and 1 distinct IFORM/disassembly combination. Those encodings are implementation choices beneath the instruction's architectural meaning; this page keeps them grouped under one mnemonic-level operation.

## Family and availability

- XED extension(s): `AMX_TILE`
- XED category/categories: `AMX_TILE`
- ISA set(s): `AMX_TILE_BASE`
- vendor classification: `shared-or-unspecified`
- XED mode restriction(s): `64`
- usable at CPL 3 subject to feature and OS enablement

## Architectural effects

Representative explicit operands: not uniformly recorded. Representative implicit state: not uniformly recorded.

Recorded flag behavior: not uniformly recorded.

## Important forms

- `TILERELEASE` — `TILERELEASE`

The form list is intentionally representative rather than a copy of every encoding row. The row-level oracle remains `generated/xed-instructions.tsv`.

## Backend notes

For Idriç this is an optimization-target candidate rather than baseline code generation. Selection should require feature-aware target information and an exact semantic oracle.
