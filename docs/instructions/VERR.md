# VERR

`VERR` tests whether the segment selected by its operand is readable at the current privilege level and reports the result in ZF. The pinned XED inventory represents it with 2 normalized encoding records and 2 distinct IFORM/disassembly combinations. Those encodings are implementation choices beneath the instruction's architectural meaning; this page keeps them grouped under one mnemonic-level operation.

## Family and availability

- XED extension(s): `BASE`
- XED category/categories: `SYSTEM`
- ISA set(s): `I286PROTECTED`
- vendor classification: `shared-or-unspecified`
- XED mode restriction(s): `16 32 64`
- usable at CPL 3 subject to feature and OS enablement

## Architectural effects

Representative explicit operands: `GPR16`; `MEM`. Representative implicit state: not uniformly recorded.

Recorded flag behavior: not uniformly recorded.

## Important forms

- `VERR_GPR16` — `VERR`
- `VERR_MEMw` — `VERR`

The form list is intentionally representative rather than a copy of every encoding row. The row-level oracle remains `generated/xed-instructions.tsv`.

## Backend notes

For Idriç this is inventory/reference material first. It should not appear in ordinary user-mode lowering; any future use belongs behind an explicit runtime, kernel, hypervisor, or privileged target boundary.
