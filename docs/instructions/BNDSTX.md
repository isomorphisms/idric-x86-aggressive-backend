# BNDSTX

`BNDSTX` stores MPX bounds metadata for a pointer into the bounds-table structures associated with the current address space. The pinned XED inventory represents it with 4 normalized encoding records and 2 distinct IFORM/disassembly combinations. Those encodings are implementation choices beneath the instruction's architectural meaning; this page keeps them grouped under one mnemonic-level operation.

## Family and availability

- XED extension(s): `MPX`
- XED category/categories: `MPX`
- ISA set(s): `MPX`
- vendor classification: `shared-or-unspecified`
- XED mode restriction(s): `16 32`, `64`
- usable at CPL 3 subject to feature and OS enablement

## Architectural effects

Representative explicit operands: `MEM BND`. Representative implicit state: not uniformly recorded.

Recorded flag behavior: not uniformly recorded.

## Important forms

- `BNDSTX_MEMbnd32_BND` — `BNDSTX`
- `BNDSTX_MEMbnd64_BND` — `BNDSTX`

The form list is intentionally representative rather than a copy of every encoding row. The row-level oracle remains `generated/xed-instructions.tsv`.

## Backend notes

For Idriç this instruction is documented independently of support status. A lowering should be added only when a typed IR operation or deliberate optimization maps to these semantics more clearly than a simpler baseline sequence.
